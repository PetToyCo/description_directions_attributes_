This service is meant to be used with a proxy server. If that is your intended use:
1. From the root directory:
npm install

2. If the database has not yet been seeded:
From within the root directory:
npm run seed

3. In client/src/index.jsx:
Make sure the proxy componentDidMount is uncommented, and the development componentDidMount is commented out. If any changes are made:
From within the root directory:
npm run react-dev

4. From within the root directory:
npm start

5. Go to the README for elizabeth_ProxyServer and follow the instructions there. Confirm that the proxy's index.html has a div tag with id='description' so that this component has a place to mount, and that the proxy's index.html has CDN script tags for "https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js" and "https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
